# Syntax:
# -----------------------------------------------------

# Pattern _____________________ Example matches ________________________________

# Literal File Names:
# /access.log			access.log
# access.log			access.log, logs/access.log, var/logs/access.log
# build/				build

# Wildcard Symbols: 
# * - matches zero or more characters.
# *.log				error.log, logs/debug.log, build/logs/error.log

# ** - match any file or zero or more directories. When followed by a slash (/), it matches only directories.
# logs/**				Matches anything inside the logs directory.
# **/build			var/build, pub/build, build
# foo/**/bar			foo/bar, foo/a/bar, foo/a/b/c/bar

# ? - matches any single character.
# access?.log			access0.log, access1.log, accessA.log
# foo??				fooab, foo23, foo0s

# [] - match any of the characters enclosed in the square brackets. When two characters are separated by a hyphen - it denotes a range of characters. The range includes all characters that are between those two characters. The ranges can be alphabetic or numeric.
# If the first character following the [ is an exclamation mark (!), then the pattern matches any character except those from the specified set.
# *.[oa]			file.o, file.a
# *.[!oa]			file.s, file.1, file.0
# access.[0-2].log		access.0.log, access.1.log, access.2.log
# file.[a-c].out			file.a.out, file.b.out, file.c.out
# file.[a-cx-z].out		file.a.out, file.b.out, file.c.out, file.x.out, file.y.out, file.z.out
# access.[!0-2].log		access.3.log, access.4.log, access.Q.log

# Negating Patterns
# ! negates (re-include) any file that is ignored by the previous pattern. The exception to this rule is to re-include a file if its parent directory is excluded.
# *.log, !error.log		error.log or logs/error.log will not be ignored

#   install all needed dependencies.
